I am currently a PhD student in [Alexandre Refregier's cosmology group](https://cosmology.ethz.ch/) at ETH Zürich. I originally come from the UK and did my undergraduate and masters studies there at Downing College, Cambridge.

My research focuses on data-driven approaches to cosmology, combining theoretical insights with modern computational methods.
