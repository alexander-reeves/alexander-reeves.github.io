## Introduction

Statistical reasoning plays a vital role in modern cosmology. In this post, we provide a journey through the statistical landscape used in cosmological analyses. We start with the very foundations laid by **Cox's theorems**, which lead naturally to **Bayesian inference** with Bayes' theorem. This then motivates a discussion of the differences between Bayesian and Frequentist approaches.

## From Cox's Theorems to Bayes' Theorem

**Cox's theorems** tell us that if we want to model degrees of plausibility with numbers, then — given a few consistency conditions — the only mathematically consistent framework is that of probability theory.

Following this, **Bayes' theorem**:

$$
P(\\theta | D) = \\frac{P(D | \\theta) P(\\theta)}{P(D)}
$$

provides the means to update our knowledge about the parameters \(\\theta\) in light of new data \(D\). Here, \(P(\\theta)\) is the prior, \(P(D | \\theta)\) is the likelihood, and \(P(\\theta | D)\) is the posterior.

## Bayesian vs. Frequentist Statistics

One of the central debates in statistics is between the:

- **Frequentist approach:** which treats parameters as fixed and data as random, emphasizing long-run frequency properties.
- **Bayesian approach:** which interprets probability as a degree of belief and treats parameters as random variables, enabling the inclusion of prior knowledge.

## Uninformative Priors and the Role of Jeffrey's Prior

When we lack precise prior knowledge, we often resort to *uninformative priors*. One popular choice in this category is **Jeffrey's prior**, which is defined as:

$$
\\pi_J(\\theta) \\propto \\sqrt{I(\\theta)}
$$

with \(I(\\theta)\) being the Fisher information. Jeffrey's prior is invariant under reparameterization, which can be advantageous for debiasing our statistics. However, it is not without challenges — sometimes it can be overly non-informative or even improper.

## Demonstration with a Jupyter Notebook

To bring these ideas to life, I've prepared a Jupyter Notebook that:

- Computes the Fisher information for a simple likelihood.
- Constructs Jeffrey's prior from that information.
- Compares the resulting posterior distributions when using a uniform (uninformative) prior versus Jeffrey's prior.

### How to Include the Notebook in Your Site

There are two common ways to share your Jupyter Notebook in the current Jekyll structure:

1. **Linking Directly to the Notebook:**

   Place the notebook (e.g., `jeffreys_prior_demo.ipynb`) in a dedicated directory in your repository, such as `assets/jupyter/`. Then add a hyperlink to it in your blog post:

   ```markdown
   [View the Jupyter Notebook demonstration for Jeffrey's Prior »]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/jupyter/jeffreys_prior_demo.ipynb)
   ```

2. **Embedding the Notebook:**

   You can convert the notebook to HTML and embed it directly in your post. One way to do this is to use a Jekyll plugin like [jekyll-nb](https://github.com/kylebarron/jekyll-nb) which automatically converts and embeds notebooks. Once set up, you can embed it with a Liquid tag:

   ```liquid
   {% nbconvert assets/jupyter/jeffreys_prior_demo.ipynb %}
   ```

   This will render the notebook as part of your blog post.

## Conclusion

In this post, we've linked the foundational ideas of probability — from Cox's theorems to Bayes' theorem — with practical issues in cosmological data analysis. The choice of priors, especially the use of Jeffrey's prior, can significantly influence the results, and I invite you to explore the demonstrated notebook for an interactive example.

### Next Steps

- **Notebook Details:**  
  If you need help drafting the contents of the `jeffreys_prior_demo.ipynb`, let me know what examples or data you'd like to include.

- **Further Customization:**  
  Check your theme's documentation to see if there is any additional configuration required for embedding notebooks, as some themes might require specific plugins or adjustments in `_config.yml`.

Do you have any questions about integrating the notebook or making further refinements to the post?
