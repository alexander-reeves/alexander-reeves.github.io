As one of Orion’s shoulders, it’s easy to spot - look for the distinctive reddish star in the upper left corner of the famous constellation.</p> <p>What makes Betelgeuse particularly exciting is its variable brightness, which you can <a href="https://www.aavso.org/LCGv2/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">track in real-time through the American Association of Variable Star Observers (AAVSO)</a>. These dramatic variations in brightness have led to intense speculation about the star’s future - Betelgeuse is near the end of its life and could go supernova at any moment. In fact, given its distance from Earth, it’s possible that Betelgeuse has <em>already</em> exploded, and we’re simply waiting for the light from this cosmic event to reach us!</p> <h2 id="finding-betelgeuse">Finding Betelgeuse</h2> <p>To locate Betelgeuse in the night sky:</p> <ol> <li>Look for Orion’s Belt - three bright stars in a row</li> <li>From the belt, look up and to the left</li> <li>The bright orange-red star you see is Betelgeuse</li> </ol> <p>The best time to observe Betelgeuse is during winter months in the Northern Hemisphere, when Orion is highest in the evening sky.</p> </body></html>
